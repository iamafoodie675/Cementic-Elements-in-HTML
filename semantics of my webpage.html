          <p>
            While cats don't speak like humans, they develop a unique set of
            vocalizations specifically for communicating with their owners. They
            don’t usually meow at other cats, but they use meowing as a way to
            communicate with humans. Each cat can have its own set of "words"
            for specific needs, like asking for food, affection, or attention.

            Unlike dogs, who have a limited range of vocalizations, cats can
            produce more than 100 distinct sounds. From meows, purrs, and chirps
            to growls and hisses, each sound can convey a different emotion or
            need.

            A cat’s whiskers are not just for measuring gaps and spaces—they’re
            incredibly sensitive to touch. The whiskers help cats sense changes
            in their surroundings and detect prey in the dark, and they even
            help them measure the width of spaces before attempting to fit
            through them.
